Welcome to the **Discord Bot Hub**! This repository contains multiple Discord bots designed for various functionalities. (If you wish to use `discord.js` instead of `discord.py`, you may go to the [JS version](https://github.com/zeusssz/discord-bot-hub/tree/js-version) of this repo. Be warned, as the JS version is extremely buggy, and the port is still not finished.)
